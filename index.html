<h3>
        Subjects of study
</h3>
<p>
       <div> At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall </div> 
       <div> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just </div> 
       <div> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued </div>
        by are as follows, in order of priority:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
            Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C <base>14 </base> H12O3.)
    </li>
    <li>
          <div>  Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the </div>
           audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10 <sup>3</sup> &gt;3 × 10<sup>4</sup> .)
    </li>
    <li>
             <u> HTML </u> and <u> CSS </u> constructs for representing musical scores.   
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
       <div> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the </div> 
       research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
</p>
<h3>
        Exotic dance moves
</h3>

<p>
       <div> Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, <i> I did </i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, </div>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
</p>
<p>
        Polynesian chicken dance
</p>
<ul>
<p>
      <div>
                A little known but <i> very </i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<u>BC</u>, a whole village would dance around 
      </div>
</p>
</ul>
    <p>
            Icelandic brownian shuffle
    </p>
    <ul>
    <p>
        <div>    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which </div>
         <div> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly </div>
         <div> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired </div> 
         modern styles such as Twerking.
    </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
            Arctic robot dance
    </p>
    <ul>
        <p>
            <div>   An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have </div>
             <div> discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants </div>
             <div> of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like </div> 
             this because they were really cold.
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
            For more of my research, see my <a href="http//:example.com"> exotic dance research page </a>.

            Yours sincerely,
    </p>
